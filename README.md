# Image Denoising Model

This repository contains an implementation of an image denoising model using advanced machine learning techniques. The project is designed to enhance the visual quality of noisy images by removing noise while preserving essential details.

---

## Features

- **Image Denoising**: Effectively removes noise from images while maintaining their structure and details.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for image restoration.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily adapt the model to different types of noise and datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OA2in/Image-Denoising-Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Denoising-Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and organize it in the `data/` directory.
2. Train the denoising model using the provided script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Test the model on noisy images:
   ```bash
   python test.py --input noisy_image.jpg --output denoised_image.jpg
   ```
4. (Optional) Visualize results using the provided tools in the repository.
